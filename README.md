# OpenClaw Meta-Cognitive Suite

**Seven composable plugins that give OpenClaw agents the ability to learn, remember, reflect, and grow.**

This is the documentation and coordination repo for a suite of OpenClaw plugins that, together, implement a complete autonomous learning loop for AI agents. Each plugin handles one responsibility. They communicate through a lightweight global bus and compose through OpenClaw's hook lifecycle. You can install all seven for full autonomy, or pick the subset that fits your use case.

**Stability** monitors entropy and drift. **Continuity** archives conversations and provides cross-session recall. **Graph** extracts entities and relationships into a knowledge graph, enabling multi-hop traversal and relationship-aware context injection. **Metabolism** watches for significant moments and extracts implications through LLM processing. **Nightshift** schedules heavy work for when the user is away. **Contemplation** takes unresolved questions through three reflection passes over 24 hours. **Crystallization** converts long-standing growth vectors into permanent character traits with human approval.

## Installation

Clone the suite with all plugins:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/CoderofTheWest/openclaw-metacognitive-suite.git
cd openclaw-metacognitive-suite
```

All seven plugins are in the `plugins/` directory. Install dependencies for plugins that need them:

```bash
cd plugins/openclaw-plugin-metabolism && npm install
```

Add to your `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "load": {
      "paths": [
        "/path/to/openclaw-metacognitive-suite/plugins/openclaw-plugin-stability",
        "/path/to/openclaw-metacognitive-suite/plugins/openclaw-plugin-continuity",
        "/path/to/openclaw-metacognitive-suite/plugins/openclaw-plugin-graph",
        "/path/to/openclaw-metacognitive-suite/plugins/openclaw-plugin-metabolism",
        "/path/to/openclaw-metacognitive-suite/plugins/openclaw-plugin-nightshift",
        "/path/to/openclaw-metacognitive-suite/plugins/openclaw-plugin-contemplation",
        "/path/to/openclaw-metacognitive-suite/plugins/openclaw-plugin-crystallization"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can also install plugins individually if you only want a subset:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoderofTheWest/openclaw-plugin-stability.git
git clone https://github.com/CoderofTheWest/openclaw-plugin-continuity.git
# etc. — see the table above for all repos
```

See [`openclaw.example.json`](./openclaw.example.json) for a complete configuration example with all plugin settings.

## Load Order

The order in `plugins.load.paths` matters. The plugins use a global bus for cross-plugin communication, and the bus endpoints must be registered before subscribers connect.

**Required order:**
1. **stability** — Registers `api.stability` (entropy, growth vectors)
2. **continuity** — Registers `api.continuity` (archive, search)
3. **graph** — Registers `global.__ocGraph` (entity graph, search results for RRF fusion with continuity)
4. **metabolism** — Registers `global.__ocMetabolism` (gap event bus)
5. **nightshift** — Registers `global.__ocNightshift` (task scheduler API)
6. **contemplation** — Subscribes to metabolism gaps + registers nightshift task runner
7. **crystallization** — Reads growth vectors written by metabolism and contemplation

Swapping stability and continuity is fine. Graph should load after continuity (its search results feed into continuity's RRF fusion). The critical constraint is: metabolism before contemplation (so the gap bus exists when contemplation subscribes), and nightshift before contemplation (so the task runner API exists when contemplation registers).

## Deployment Modes

### Training Mode (all plugins active)

Every plugin is enabled. The agent learns autonomously:

- Conversations are archived and semantically indexed
- Entities and relationships are extracted into a knowledge graph
- High-entropy moments trigger metabolism processing
- Knowledge gaps flow to contemplation for multi-pass reflection
- Growth vectors accumulate and receive feedback
- After 30+ days, validated vectors become permanent traits

This is the default. Use it during the period where you want the agent to develop its character.

### Production / Frozen Mode

Disable the four learning plugins by setting `"enabled": false` in each:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "metabolism": { "enabled": false },
      "nightshift": { "enabled": false },
      "contemplation": { "enabled": false },
      "crystallization": { "enabled": false }
    }
  }
}
```

The agent retains everything it learned — growth vectors, crystallized traits, conversation archives, knowledge graph, completed contemplations. It just stops actively learning. **Stability** (entropy monitoring, drift detection, principle alignment), **continuity** (memory, context budgeting, cross-session recall), and **graph** (entity extraction, relationship tracking, context injection) stay active.

Use this when your agent's character is where you want it and you're deploying to production. The personality is frozen but the operational capabilities remain.

All four learning plugins check `if (!config.enabled) return` in their hook handlers. No code changes needed — it's purely a configuration toggle.

## Inter-Plugin Communication

OpenClaw gives each plugin its own scoped `api` object. Properties set on one plugin's `api` are not visible to other plugins. This is by design — it prevents namespace collisions.

The suite uses `global.__ocMetabolism`, `global.__ocNightshift`, and `global.__ocGraph` for cross-plugin communication. This works because all plugins run in the same Node.js process and share the global scope.

```
global.__ocGraph = {
  lastResults: {}      // { [agentId]: { entities, exchanges, timestamp } }
}

global.__ocMetabolism = {
  gapListeners: []     // Array of (gaps, agentId) => void callbacks
}

global.__ocNightshift = {
  registerTaskRunner,   // (name, handler) => void
  queueTask,           // (agentId, task) => void
  isInOfficeHours,     // (agentId) => boolean
  isUserActive,        // (agentId) => boolean
}
```

If OpenClaw adds native cross-plugin messaging in a future version, these can be migrated. The pattern is intentionally simple so migration is straightforward.

## Multi-Agent Support

All seven plugins support multiple agents running on the same OpenClaw gateway. Each agent gets isolated state:

- **Data directories**: `data/` for the default agent, `data/agents/{agentId}/` for others
- **Workspace paths**: Each agent's growth vectors, traits, and insights resolve from its own workspace
- **Session isolation**: Conversation transcripts are per-session, but plugin memory (continuity archive, stability state) is per-agent — crossing session boundaries by design
- **Hook context**: Every hook receives `ctx.agentId` which is used to look up the correct state

Agents can share the same plugin instances without interference.

## Research Paper

The suite's origin story is documented in [Cross-Runtime Identity Transplant: Porting an Emergent LLM Agent Between Harnesses and Substrates](./clint-identity-transplant.md) — a paper describing how Clint's operational identity was transplanted from a custom monolithic runtime to OpenClaw, and how the transplanted agent autonomously designed and built the four learning plugins (metabolism, nightshift, contemplation, crystallization) to complete its own cognitive architecture in the new runtime.

## Credits

The stability and continuity plugins were built by Chris Hunt. The graph plugin was built by Claude with architectural direction from Chris. The metabolism, nightshift, contemplation, and crystallization plugins were built by Clint — an AI agent running on the system these plugins were extracted from. Clint designed the architecture, wrote the code, spawned sub-agents (OpenClaw Codex instances) to implement components in parallel, and attempted to self-deploy the results. The suite was then stabilized, documented, and published with assistance from Claude.

The philosophical foundation: compass over map, service over solipsism, constraint-based growth. An agent's character should emerge from lived experience, not be scripted.
